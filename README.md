Data Transformations to Handle Outliers
## Overview
Outliers can significantly skew and bias data, affecting the results of data analysis and machine learning models. Transformations are an effective way to mitigate the impact of outliers, stabilize variance, reduce skewness, and normalize data distributions. This repository provides a guide on applying various data transformations using Python to handle outliers effectively..

## Features
  - Understanding Data Transformations: Learn about different types of transformations and their purposes.
  + Applying Transformations: Instructions on applying log, square root, Box-Cox, and Yeo-Johnson transformations in Python.
  * Visualizing Transformations: Tools and scripts to visualize the effects of transformations on data distributions.


## Transformations Included
  1. Log Transformation: Reduces right skewness and minimizes the impact of large outliers.
  2. Square Root Transformation: Less aggressive than log transformation, suitable for moderately skewed data.
  3. Box-Cox Transformation: A power transformation that normalizes data and is suitable for positive data values.
  4. Yeo-Johnson Transformation: An adaptable transformation that can handle both positive and negative data values.

## Understanding the Visualizations
  - Original Data: Shows the initial distribution with outliers.
  + Log Transformation: Compresses the scale of the data, reduces the extremes values.
  * Square Root Transformation: this reduces skewness better than log transformations.
  - Box-Cox Transformation: Identifies and decides the optimal power transformation to normalize the data.
  + Yeo-Johnson Transformation: A flexible transformation that handles a range of data, including negatives.
